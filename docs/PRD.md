# Middle School Non-Academic Skills Measurement System (MASS) – PRD
### Version 2.0 — Final

---

## 1. Executive Summary
MASS provides continuous, objective measurement of non-academic skills in middle school students using four integrated evidence layers:
1. Baseline Assessment
2. Game-based Behavioral Measurement
3. AI-driven Classroom Transcript and Project Analysis
4. Teacher Rubric Evaluation

The system identifies skills such as empathy, adaptability, collaboration, critical thinking, and self-regulation — and presents actionable insights to teachers and administrators.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Middle schools lack scalable, objective tools to measure non-academic skills. Current SEL assessments rely on:
- Subjective teacher observations
- Inconsistent self-reports
- Infrequent evaluations
- Lack of continuous feedback

MASS solves this by delivering automated, continuous skill intelligence through AI-driven analysis of real-world interactions and structured behavioral data.
