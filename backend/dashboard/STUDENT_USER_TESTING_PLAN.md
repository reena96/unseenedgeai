### Emotional Safety
- Stop testing immediately if student becomes upset
- Frame all feedback as "helping us improve," not testing the student
- Allow students to skip questions or tasks
- Emphasize there are no wrong answers

### Parental Rights
- Parents can review materials beforehand
- Parents can withdraw consent at any time
- Parents receive summary of findings (no individual results)
